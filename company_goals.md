Bug Fixing

Measure*
Reference: Per 5 story points
No. of defects <=2 - 100 %
No. of defects equal to 3 - 75%
No. of defects >3 and <=5 - 25
No. of defects > 5 - 0%
NOTE: For other story point the above numbers will be adjusted proportionately (This measure is just a guidance and may vary based on scenario)
JIRA will be the only source considered as evidence.
Pre-Release defects: Zero blocker/critical/major open bugs (non-legacy)at the final day of release, any exceptions should be discussed & approved by the client.
We need to ensure zero regression and proper analysis of all impacted dependent feature/module to avoid bug should not be reopened or introduce new one.

Evidence*
No. of defects are less than 2.
There is no blocker in release of admin objects. Released with no bugs.

Task
Coding
Code review

Measure*
Reference: Per 5 story points

No. of review defects/major/medium comment(s) upto 1 - 100 %
No. of review defects/major/medium comment(s) equal to 2 - 75%
No. of review defects/major/medium comment(s) >2 and <=4 - 25
No. of review defects/major/medium comment(s) > 4 - 0%
NOTE: For other story point the above numbers will be adjusted proportionately

Evidence*
No of review comments are 2. Incorporated all comments and updated the code.

Task
Coding
Implementation using a programming language

Measure*
Complete 100% (in terms of story points) allotted work on assigned new features/fix bugs .(x% for x% of tasks completed) subject to that the delay was not caused by any external factors (delay from client in requirements, personal emergency etc.)
JIRA will be the only source considered as evidence.
Unused code cleanup (Sonar/TSLint best practices should be followed - Should keep the code clean and while development should also correct the bad practices which are already there in the code.
Lighthouse/GTMetrix should be used to check UI performance
Should write well-optimized code.
Proper Dev box and Unit testing should be done for the written code.
Feature completion: Complete all in scope features for the release in acceptance with the product owner.

Evidence*
Complete 100% allotted work on assigned new features/fix bugs.
I have cleaned the code and also improved the code by using TSLint. Implement best practice while writing code.
Written the well-optimized code.
I have done the Proper Dev box and Unit testing.
Completed all in scope features for the release in acceptance with the product owner.

Task
Coding
Writing Unit Test cases

Measure*

100% for > 80% coverage,
75 % for 60% - 75%,
50% for 40% - 60%,
25% for 25% - 40%,
0% for < 25%

Evidence*
I have Written the Code with more than 85 percent  code coverage.

Task
