What was the most challenging project you worked on?
I worked on a food ordering enterprise app that we need to make in online and offline mode. This requirement comes after a certain level of stage when we already developed an app. The offline mode part was a little challenging. After doing some POCs we accomplished that.

Please give me an example of when you had to assume leadership for an outcome, project, and/or team.
I was assigned to lead a team of three colleagues when I joined the current organization. We had to develop various features and solve lint problems because we have implemented new coding rules so that code will be more readable. So to achieve this we properly analyze issues and achieve the things on time. For this I also received a spot award in my current organization.

What’s the best idea you’ve come up with on a team-based project?
On a team based project the first thing is if we are working on some feature if there is any gap they should communicate to the reporting manager if there is any issue. There should not be a communication gap between team members. They should be team players also. If someone is stuck somewhere should support/help them. They should also have an open learning attitude to learn new things. 

Can you share an experience where a project dramatically shifted directions at the last minute? What did you do?
Yeah in 1 project there is a deadline to complete search functionality. Initially the approach is different but in the last minute the product manager pitches another approach which takes lots of code base change. But we handled it by putting extra effort. I think for handling these things I keep a problem solving attitude, continuous positivity, and willingness to learn.

What do you do if you disagree with your manager
Well this does not happen much. Manager carries a lot of experience so we cannot disagree on their points. Because they know a more clear vision. One time, I disagreed with my manager over some jira ticket which we need to develop a feature. I respectfully expressed my opinion and ultimately, it was resolved. It worked out well, and we both maintained open and honest communication with each other.

Can you tell us about the most challenging project / work you have done? How did you & your team overcome difficulties?
A large-scale website redesign for a client was the most challenging project I’ve ever worked on. This was a complex project involving a lot of coordination with many different stakeholders.
Our goal was to maintain the existing brand identity while maintaining a modern, up-to-date design. The client also had multiple user personas with very different needs and expectations, so we had to ensure we catered to them.
The biggest challenge of this project was the tight deadline. We had to deliver a complete redesign in just two months. This meant that we had to work quickly while still ensuring that every detail was perfect. In order to ensure that all aspects of the project were completed on time, we also had to coordinate our work with other teams and departments.
A challenging project but one that was incredibly rewarding. We successfully completed the project within the timeline, and the client was extremely pleased with the results
